# Breakout game

## Not the one with the ball bouncing on bricks

## From the description


>	Breakthrough is a game of abstract strategy invented by Dan Troyka in 2000. It is played on a rectangular board, originally 7x7, with pieces of two colors. We > implement the 8x8 version, which won a game design prize in 2001. A number of web pages describe the game and its rules, which we summarize here.
> Initially, each player's 16 pieces occupy the two rows of the board nearest the player. In a player's turn, one piece is moved one position forward or diagonally > forward. An opponent's piece may be captured only by diagonal forward moves, and captures are not mandatory. The winner is the first to move a piece to the 
> opponent's back row.
